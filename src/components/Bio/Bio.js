      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Marlon Agno and I am a full stack web developer. As a scientist and engineer, I aspire to cultivate a genuine curiosity of the world around me.  After graduating with a degree in engineering and working as a research engineer, I still saw a big gap in my personal understanding of one of the pillar technologies that the world is built on today, software. I chose to become a full-stack developer to achieve a deeper understanding of technology, as well as be in a field that is conducive to challenging myself and continually learning. </p>
